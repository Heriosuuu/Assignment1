YOASOBI Website revamp
------------------------

The purpose of this project was to create a way so that fans like myself, can learn more about YOASOBI and the artists that are part of the group. The project includes albums, backgrounds of artists and also updates on how their tour is going. The website displays a aesthetic hip hop feel to the design theme which is mainly based on the songs the group produces.



Design Process
-----------------------

The main target group for this website is to not just fans but people who are interested in knowing more about Japanese-POP or the group in general. It provides opportunities for fans to catch up with new songs, find out which songs are trending at the moment with videos and audio files for them to give it a listen. One other feature include a concert page where it shows where the group has already performed or toured before, and also showcase where their newest and upcoming concert show would be located at. Allowing fans from all around the world to follow them and their tours.

Some things that users would want from this website are:

1. Being able to get to know the artists better
2. Learn about the backstory of the group
3. New released songs
4. Top song releases and general albums overview
5. History of concert shows
6. Upcoming tickets for new concert


As a user type, I want to perform an action, so that I can achieve a goal.
This section is also where you would sinks to any wireframes, mockups, diagrams etc. that you created as part of the design process. These files should themselves either be included as a pdf file in the project itself (in an separate directory) Include the Adobhare le XD wireframe as a folder. You can include the XD share url.

2. Listen now button under the album section which brings users directly to album page for them to listen to songs

4. Back to top button that allows users to smoothly go back to top of page without scrolling

5. Under album page, video player allows users to play a music video of most recent song release

6. Play button beside the video uses a javascript that changes "Play" to "Pause" when user select it, alternating the names when clicked other way round. Button works as its linked to playing and pausing of actual video

Testing
-----------------
For any scenarios that have not been automated, test the user stories manually and provide as much detail as is relevant. A particularly useful form for describing your testing process is via scenarios, such as:

Video play:
Go to "Album" page
Try to start the video by pressing on the "Play" button under the text
Check to see if the text in the button changes from "Play" to "Pause"
Open up the video in fullscreen or picture in picture mode to make sure it fits
Try adjusting the volume to make sure it works

Contact form:
Go to the "Contact Us" page
Try to submit the empty form and verify that an error message about the required fields appears
Try to submit the form with an invalid email address and verify that a relevant error message appears
Try to submit the form with all inputs valid and verify that a success message appears.
In addition, you should mention in this section how your project looks and works on different browsers and screen sizes.

Audio play:
Go to "Album" page
Scroll down to the top hits for songs
Play any of the songs to make sure each song is uniquely different
Check if playing,pausing,volume and adjustment of time is working

(Potential bugs: the song "Idol" appears in both top and trending hits. Sometimes playing one of them
may start the other one too. FIXED BUT MAY REAPPEAR)
