        <h1>ABOUT US</h1>

        <p>Yoasobi is a Japanese superduo formed in 2019 by Sony Music Entertainment Japan, composed of Vocaloid producer Ayase and singer-songwriter Ikura. 
          Represented by the slogan "novel into music", the duo originally released songs based on selected short stories posted on Monogatary.com, a social media website for creative writing operated by the label.
           Stories were later also sourced from various media like stories written by professional authors, books, letters, and plays, etc.

        The word Yoasobi stands for 'nightlife': a metaphor for the project's sense of adventure, away from their respective solo careers.

        After some experimentation, the duo debuted with debut single 'Into The Night', a song inspired by a Mayo Hoshino short story about obsession and death. 
        Released just before the world plunged into the coronavirus pandemic, the song's mix of dark lyrical themes, 
        Ayase's funky electropop production and Ikura's soaring delivery proved lightning in a bottle amid Japan's lockdown-induced malaise.
          
        Soon, it was making history, racking up over 500 million streams in Japan and therefore becoming the country's first-ever song to be certified diamond on streaming. 
        YOASOBI quickly became household names, going from online shows to performing at the legendary Nippon Budokan venue and Kohaku Uta Gassen, the prestigious year-end music show by national broadcaster NHK.

        After going viral on social media, Yoasobi's debut single, "Yoru ni Kakeru", gave them their breakthrough by topping the Billboard Japan Hot 100 for six non-consecutive weeks and the 2020 year-end chart, as well as becoming the first song in Recording Industry Association of Japan (RIAJ) history to be certified diamond for streaming. 
        It was followed by several successful singles, such as Blue Period-inspired "Gunjō", and anime series themes "Kaibutsu" and "Yasashii Suisei" for Beastars (2021), "Shukufuku" for Mobile Suit Gundam: The Witch from Mercury (2022),
        "Idol" for Oshi no Ko (2023), and "Yūsha" for Frieren: Beyond Journey's End (2023); "Idol" topped the Japan Hot 100 for 21 consecutive weeks, the longest-running number one, and the Billboard Global Excl. 
        US, the first Japanese act to do so.
